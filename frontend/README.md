# CommunityConnect – A Civic Engagement and Social Impact Platform

## 🚀 Project Overview

CommunityConnect is a full-stack platform built to bridge the gap between citizens, NGOs, and donors. It empowers communities by simplifying volunteer coordination, promoting donation transparency, and enabling citizens to raise and track local civic issues. This platform directly addresses real-world challenges such as lack of volunteer-matching systems, inaccessible NGOs, opaque donation usage, exclusion of marginalized groups, and the absence of civic reporting tools.

## Key Features

=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
