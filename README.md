- Volunteers can easily discover and apply for NGO opportunities.  
- NGOs can post project needs, manage volunteer applications, and showcase their impact.  
- Donors can give with confidence, track fund usage, and support verified causes.  
- Citizens can report civic issues with photos and geolocation, track progress, and increase visibility through community upvotes.  
- Admins can approve NGOs, oversee issue management, and ensure a safe, transparent environment.
