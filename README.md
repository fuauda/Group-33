# MediLink â€“ A Modern Healthcare Management System (MERN Stack)

MediLink is a full-stack healthcare platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This project tackles real problems in healthcare like long patient wait times, missing medical history, poor rural access, and untracked medicine stocks.

Our goal is to provide an efficient, accessible, and scalable healthcare system for clinics, hospitals, and underserved communities.

## Core Features

### Appointment Scheduling and Queue Tracking
Patients can book appointments online, and both patients and doctors can see real-time queue updates. This helps reduce long wait times and crowding in clinics.

### Unified Medical History
Patients have a digital profile that includes their past visits, prescriptions, and reports. Doctors can securely view this history before and during consultations to offer better care.

### Remote Video Consultations
Patients can consult doctors through video calls without needing to visit the hospital. This is especially useful for rural users or minor follow-ups.

### Pharmacy and Medicine Stock Management
Pharmacists can track available medicines, monitor expiry dates, and get notified when stocks are low or out. Doctors can also check availability before prescribing.

### Basic Health Record Upload
Patients and doctors can upload health documents like lab results or prescriptions. All files are securely stored and can be viewed anytime.
