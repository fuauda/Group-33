# System Architecture Process â€“ CommunityConnect


## 1. Define Your Objectives  


**CommunityConnect Goals**:
- **Scalability**: Must support thousands of users (citizens, NGOs, donors) reporting and viewing civic issues
- **Security**: Role-based access, encrypted data, secure authentication
- **Usability**: Simple UI for low-tech users in underserved areas
- **Availability**: Targeting 99.9% uptime for critical civic reporting features
- **Maintainability**: Clean modular codebase for a rotating team or open-source contributors
- **Transparency**: Clear donation and NGO data flows to build user trust

## 2. Identify Stakeholders  


**Key Stakeholders**:
- **Citizens**: Reporting civic issues, accessing services
- **NGOs**: Managing projects and volunteers
- **Donors**: Funding local campaigns and tracking usage
- **Volunteers**: Searching for and participating in opportunities
- **Admins**: Ensuring platform integrity and safety
- **Developers**: Responsible for building and maintaining system components
- **Government/Local Authorities** (future): May receive and act on verified reports

---

## 3. Gather Requirements  


**Key Requirements**:
- **Reliable Communication**: REST APIs over HTTP for standard web traffic
- **Real-time Updates (future)**: Potential WebSocket integration for live civic issue status
- **Database**: NoSQL (MongoDB) to support flexible, fast-growing schemas (issues, reports, donations)
- **Media Uploads**: Firebase or S3-compatible object storage for civic issue photos

## ðŸ’» 4. Design the Architecture  

### Client (Frontend)
- React.js with Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Zustand for state management
- Axios for API communication
- React Router for navigation

### Server (Backend)
- Node.js with Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT for authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- CORS for cross-origin requests

## 5. Prototype and Test  

**Prototype/Test Strategy**:
- **RESTful API Prototyping**: Design and test endpoints using Postman
- **Frontend Pages**: Wireframed and implemented using component-based architecture
- **API Security Testing**: Verify access restrictions using protected route testing
- **Forms and UX Testing**: Validate forms for creating issues, uploading media, and applying for opportunities
- **Real-time Communication** *(future roadmap)*: Explore WebSocket or polling for live civic issue status tracking

---

## 6. Implement and Monitor  


**Deployment + Monitoring Plan**:
- **Deployment**: 
  - Frontend: Vercel
  - Backend: Railway or Heroku
- **Caching**: 
  - Browser-side caching via service workers
  - Future: Redis for caching popular NGOs or trending issues
- **CDN**: Vercel's built-in CDN for frontend asset delivery
- **Monitoring**: 
  - Use tools like UptimeRobot, LogRocket, or Sentry
  - Backend logs via Railway or external logging services
- **Message Queues** (Future Enhancement):
  - For processing media uploads or donation confirmations asynchronously

## Summary

CommunityConnectâ€™s architecture is intentionally designed to meet the technical, civic, and social demands of the platform. By following the 6-step architectural thinking process and grounding each phase in practical decisions, the system is built for clarity, growth, and real-world impact.
